    <h2>About the project</h2>
    <p>Hello from Flora and Laura at MUSE! We're just getting started, but we wanted to let you know a little more about who we are and what we're doing. Scroll down to find out about the site and what we're offering. If you need any more info, don't hestitate to <a href=contact.html>get in touch</a> with us and let us know.</p>
    <p> Muse was created by Flora and Laura for the CodeFirst:Girls beginners course. Using their newfound coding skills, the two decided to combine their interests and create a website and map of some of the best museums in the world. They've been lucky enough to travel to lots of them, and those they haven't they've heard really good things about! Visit our <a href=map.html>map</a> to have a look for yourself, and to find out more about each museum.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://www.codefirstgirls.org.uk/">CodeFirst: Girls</a></h3>
        <p>CodeFirst: Girls is a Not for Profit Social Enterprise that works to develop coding skills exclusively with women in Britain. They run free, part-time coding courses for young women/university students across the UK and Ireland. Flora and Laura have been learning to code on the transform beginners program. Whilst on the course they have learnt html, css and javascript, and have almost managed to master GitHub!</p>

        <h3>Flora</h3>
        <p>Flora is currently working as a Mapping Technician in Cambridge. She recently completed a Master's in Geographical Information Systems and she loves making maps. Her favourite museum is the 21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art in Kanazawa, Japan. Flora feels passionately about getting more women in tech and has found the CF:G beginner's course inspiring and rewarding!</p>

        <h3>Laura</h3>
        <p>Laura is working to get her Master's in History of Design at the V&A Museum. She hopes to one day work in the museums herself, but until then enjoys discovering new ones around the world. Her favourite museum of all time is the Garage Museum of Contemporary Art in Moscow, but the V&A is a close second! Laura is learning to code because she enjoys design and likes to learn new things.</p>
